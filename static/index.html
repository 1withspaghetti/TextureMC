            <i>The pack editor & signup have been disabled, but feel free to still download your packs and edit them using different services or <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Creating_a_resource_pack">try it yourself</a> (I highly recommend using <a href="https://www.blockbench.net/">blockbench</a> for its pixel art editor)</i>

          <p>
            I am a solo developer and to be honest, I don't have any motivation to keep working on this project, and not much time either.
            The server computing power (and especially server space) is too expensive for me to keep running, especially as a high school student going off to college in the coming months.
            Minecraft used to be so special to be, but now I don't play it anymore and I've moved to other games and larger projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I could hand this off to another developer to work on it, I don't think it would be worth it. The codebase is terrible because I made this so long ago, as one of my first projects, and I don't trust anybody else with y'alls data. (I will make sure to delete all of it before shutting down the server)
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              I will be shutting down the server and deleting everything on July 31st, 2025, so please make sure to download your packs before then.
            </b>
